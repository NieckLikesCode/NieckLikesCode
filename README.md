### Mahlzeit 👋

I use this website to upload code of programs that I either needed myself or whose programming or functionality interests me. I believe software should be free and open, so feel free to reuse my code for anything you want. If you do use my code in a public project, a mention is by no means necessary, but I would be very happy to see where my code has ended up. Also, check out [this very sleepy cat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1UWsBJ5HgU)
